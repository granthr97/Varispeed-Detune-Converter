# Varispeed-Detune-Converter
Converts between semitone shifts and Varispeed percentages for Logic Pro X.

Back before the feature was added to Logic Pro X to allow the user to shift the speed of the project by a certain number of semitones, one had to do math to figure out how many semitones a Varispeed percentage would shift the project by. This project solves just that problem.

Instructions are included in the code. Enjoy!
